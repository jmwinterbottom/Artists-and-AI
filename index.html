            <h2>THE FUTURE OF ART AS WE KNOW IT</h2>
            <p>
                The year is 2023. The world is at a tipping point. Artificial Intelligence is no longer resigned to the world of science fiction but has 
                begun to permeate our everyday lives. Whilst more primitive examples have become a mainstay in our homes in the form of toys, gadgets and 
                virtual assistants, newer, more advanced tools can do much more exciting things. These latest tools divide the art world as AI's potential 
                to create stunning pieces of art, from seemingly nothing, improves exponentially.
            <br> 
            <br>
                Established in the year 2088, Talos Industries will lead the way in AI innovation. Through incredible technological breakthroughs, Talos 
                Industries are able to transmit data into the past that will allow us to glimpse at the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence and observe 
                its impact on the creative industry.
            

            <h2>INTRODUCING: AND-E</h2>
            <center>
                <Img src="images/and-e.png" alt="an image of AND-E, the AI created by Talos Industries with the company logo, a golem like robot"

            <p>
                72% of emerging creatives believe that AI will make the task of creating art easier. Artists with specialisms in more digital-leaning areas 
                are very positive about the streamlining of processes. They feel that this will “free their time to do more creative things”.
            <br>
            <br>
                Talos Industries’ flagship product AND-E aims to do exactly that. AND-E bears the likeness of his human predecessor Andy Warhol. Warhol was 
                an innovator, he introduced new, advanced, practices such as mechanical reproduction into his work (Galeson, 2022). Like AI, he would base 
                paintings directly on photographs, not dissimilar to how deep-learning tools like Midjourney and Dall-e work today (McFadden, 2023). This 
                makes his resemblance the perfect avatar for the AI assistant.

                Not all artists are optimistic about the developments of AI. Some are concerned about what the intentions of corporations like Talos Industries might be.

                    <h3>ARTIFEX: ART AND AUTOMATION</h3>
                    <p>
                    <img src="images/artifex.png" alt="a blueprint of the ARTIFEX droid" style=width 100%">
                    <br>
                    Over 58.2% of artists believe, at some level, that their creative abilities could be replaced by machines. In the future, these concerns could become a reality with the release of products such as ARTFIEX. Talos Industries’ latest gadget is a fully automated droid. It places AND-E inside a portable and articulated ‘body’ enhancing its ability to create art independently. Whilst the purpose of ARTIFEX is to provide creatives with an autonomous, automated, assistant, this will make assistant-level roles redundant. The fact that the AI is also able to create without any human input raises concerns that artists could be superseded entirely. These images show the ARTIFEX droids in action. From studying art to be utilised later to archiving forgotten and undesirable works of art.

                    54.6% of artists feel negatively toward AI and there are concerns that this is the future we can expect. This study has shown that whilst creatives can currently tell apart art created by a human from that made by a machine, they feel that non-creatives won’t care. This is echoed by similar studies that show people struggle to tell the difference between the two (Gangadharbatla, 2021).

                <br>
                <br>
                    Whilst some artists fear machines will replace them, 41.8% feel that their creative abilities are unique enough that machines are unable to replicate them. This suggests that while some works in galleries may be produced with the assistance of machines, there will always be a need for human input.
                <br>
                <br>
                    This after all is the purpose of ARTIFEX, not to replace artists but to assist them. The majority of artists do believe that AI will make the creative process easier. An overwhelming 72.6% of those asked would agree with this to some extent. The majority of these creatives (67.9%) would even consider using them in their work for both personal and professional use.

The results are 32.1% would not at all, 1% would for personal use, 41.1% for personal and professional use and 25% for personal use.">

                    However, due to the efficiency of these tools, there are always concerns that individuals could use them to make some easy money. These concerns are amplified when considering what huge corporations could do with these tools.  While corporations may seek to replace employees and make creative more content cheaply, there are other concerns around ethics. Companies have been accused by artists of stealing content to train artificial intelligence to mimic certain styles (Gleave and Powell, 2023).  This has damaged the reputation of these tools in the eyes of the public. 
                <br>

                <I>
                    “The art-theft aspect of AI tools is probably what has damaged their reputation the most, and with good reason.” 
                </I>    - Comic book artist
                <br>
                <br>
                    Whilst art theft is a major and serious concern, corporations and governments may seek to use these tools for even more nefarious means such as spreading disinformation. This even furthers concerns that artists already have about the damage of such tools.

                <h2>CHANGING THE FUTURE</h2>

                <p>
                    The future that Talos Industries presents doesn't need to be one artist's fear. This study has given artists a platform to share both their wants and fears from Artificial Intelligence tools. Whilst artists accept that embracing AI is something that cannot be avoided, some factors need to be addressed before this can happen.  
                <br>
                <br>
                    AI tools that simply generate art with little effort are rejected by artists for numerous reasons. These range from their lack of creativity to their apparent breach of ethics. However, artists are willing to use tools which allow them to reach their goals more efficiently. If tools can be produced that allow artists to focus on the creative aspect of their work and they can be developed with artists involvement they can ensure that AI can be beneficial without exploiting artists.
