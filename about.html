                Talos Industries is a fictional organisation dreamt up by Jordan Winterbottom as part of his final year project in Digital Media and Communications 
                at Manchester Metropolitan University.  As a fan of Sci-Fi cinema, Jordan invoked the feeling of fear and uncertainty that is common with movies of 
                this genre.  Inspiration was taken from films which focus heavily on the concept of AI such as 'Blade Runner' and '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  Talos Industries 
                is presented in a retro-futuristic style that is shared with these films from the 70s and 80s.

                By telling a fictional story in this transmedia piece, Jordan highlights the real hopes and concerns of emerging artists who participated in a research 
                project titled: <b>Will Artists Embrace or Reject AI?</b>  Their input was used to create all the content on this website including the animated video and photography pieces.  
                These were produced by Jordan using his existing creative talents and taking on new ones.

                The animated video asset utilises an AI-generated avatar based on recreation of an image Andy Warhol.  This is then transformed through the use of 
                Adobe After Effects to recreate a sci-fi interface that bears similarities to those seen in science fiction.  The photography, taken inside Manchester Art Gallery, 
                shows an entirely original 3D model created by Jordan for this project.  This was produced in Blender and is Jordan’s first attempt at creating something with this program.
